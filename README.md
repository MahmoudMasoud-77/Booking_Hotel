# Booking_Hotel
<p>
1. Booking Database
2. Web service (API) to have all the logic of the system, e.g. find availability for the selected
  time, book, cancel, update the DB with the booked or cancelled room(s). 
3. Application interface Back-end, this should NOT have any logic and
should only communicate with the Web service (API).
4. Application interface Front-end 
5. A report-like page to display all the rooms in the hotel and their status, e.g., booked,
available. This page should authenticate the user before displaying the report.
</p>
## Required Considerations
<p>
- The system should deal with the hotel branches / locations. The booking needs to be in
a specific branch / location of the hotel.
- The system should allow booking several rooms under one booking name.
- The system should give facility to booking rooms of different types, e.g., single, double,
suite, and should allow booking multiple persons in a double room or a suite.
- The system should give a discounted price (95%) if the customer has booked previously
in the hotel.
